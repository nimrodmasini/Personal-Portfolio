  <!-- About -->
  <section id="about" class="container section-card">
    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a data scientist passionate about uncovering actionable insights from complex data. I specialize in machine
      learning, data visualization, and storytelling with data. My goal is to bridge the gap between raw data and
      meaningful decision-making by building intelligent systems and intuitive dashboards.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have hands-on experience in developing predictive models, conducting deep exploratory analysis, and building
      dashboards that drive business performance. With a background in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, I bring a
      structured and results-driven approach to solving real-world problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical stack includes <strong>Python (with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Matplotlib, and
        Seaborn), SQL, Power BI, Excel, and Jupyter/Colab notebooks</strong>. I’m skilled in data cleaning,
      visualization, model development (classification, regression, clustering), and working with APIs and ETL
      pipelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m certified in <strong>Data Science</strong> by <strong>ALX Africa</strong>. This program equipped me with
      practical, project-based experience and reinforced my ability to work collaboratively, think critically, and build
      solutions that add value.
